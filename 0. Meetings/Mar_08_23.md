Many thanks for the update — Dima is indeed a fast learner, I am sure he will pick this up very quickly! Please do keep me posted on how this progresses. There is no due date for the analysis and output, but it would be helpful to know the following related things:

1. quality of the sequence data 
2. the potential of these data (amount of output, read length etc.) to be used for de novo assembly of genomes like these — small size but complex in terms of number of chromosomes.

We can meet on Monday or Tuesday next week, but we don’t have to. I will be in California March 15-23rd, but will be available to communicate via email (and zoom if needed). 

If we could get a sense of items 1 and 2 by the end of next week or so (i.e., March 17th), that would be very helpful. To be clear, I am not asking for polished assemblies for #2, just a sense of how easily the data come together after some preliminary assembly tests (depth of coverage, # of contigs, etc.).

I know that Dima is busy prepping for his IESLT, so I appreciate his time. 

best wishes,
john
